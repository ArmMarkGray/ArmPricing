# ArmPricing

**Assumptions**

ASP.net MVC most likely with Razor as it is the most common tempting framework for asp.net
Asking for optional and mandatory fields so you expect validation, possibly implies a JS framework?
Entities would include:
Customer
ContactDetails
Product
PricingQuery, i.e., the sum of all product prices

This entities would be saved to a DB most likely MSSQL as we are using Asp.net MVC but could easily be a document db or some other NoSql Db.

PricingQuery will consist of one or more Product (this will be a snapshot of the Product because features may change over time)
Customer will consist of one or more PricingQueries and ContactDetail

A service will be needed to handle the saving of the Customer, ContactDetails, Products and PricingQueries
A service will be needed to implement emailing

Maintainability: use cvs; Github, will also serve as a means to share the code. You are looking for Design Patterns (Gang of Four) to be employed, thinking SOLID, TDD etc., this will help to ensure the code is extensible and provides some level of security that if the code changes bugs wonâ€™t be introduced. Overall, keep it simple, ensure you only design what you need for now without prematurely optimising, which adds complexity and assumes a way forward that locks you into an approach that might not actually be correct.
